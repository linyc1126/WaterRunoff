## Introduction
This project explores the hydrological implications and applications of multi-scale runoff analysis, By examining runoff dynamics across spatial and temporal scales, the study investigates the potential of using hydrological runoff as a design index. The research based on the sedimentation ponds in Xizhou, Taiwan, bridging the macro and micro perspectives of hydrological systems and their interaction with human interventions.

**Applications**
- Drainage key design area reference
- Predicting potential flood zones
- Supporting simulations for runoff and infiltration models
         
**Key Source**         
- DEM Models of research area(.tif file is prefered)
- Hydrological data
1. Meteorological data(evapotranspiration, precipitation rates) 
2. Soil properties
- Can get the Example and reference website in the 'Example' Folder
   
**Simulation Models**
- QGIS&SAGA

**Feature**
- GIS is needed in the research, visualizing all the data!(QGIS is used in the research)
- After running your own analysis, Overlaying may be helpful to stimulate some idea!

**Reference**

During the process, you'll need some of the surveying and mapping data from authoritative institutions as the reference for research.
Usually can get theses datas from government's open data platform. (.shp file is prefered)
- Existing hydrological runoff data
- Existing slope data
