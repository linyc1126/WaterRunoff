## Introduction
This project explores the hydrological implications and applications of multi-scale runoff analysis, By examining runoff dynamics across spatial and temporal scales, the study investigates the potential of using hydrological runoff as a design index. The research based on the sedimentation ponds in Xizhou, Taiwan, bridging the macro and micro perspectives of hydrological systems and their interaction with human interventions.

**Applications**

．Drainage key design area reference
